	ARRAY TEXTURES FOR THE FUCKING VOXELS
		=> Instanced indexing of the texture/material for voxel meshes
		=> 16x, 32x, 64x up to 128x, 256x, 512x textures depending on settings (along with downscaling)
		=> Animated textures ?
		=> 
		
		We'd want support for at LEAST 1024 32x32 8bpp textures
		
		A mess. Fuck it, the atlas works.
	
	No more summary mesh generation on the CPU. DONE!
